# Dropcode - random pieces of useful code

## About

I've decided to collect under one directory, all the various bits and pieces of
marginally useful code I usually carry around from project to project. Each of
these pieces of code are not large or important enough to make a proper library
out of them, yet I find myself needing them again and again.

each file you wish to use). I don't expect there will be any copyrighted files
in here, but if there are any, they will always be under a free software
